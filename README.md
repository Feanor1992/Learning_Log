# Learning_Log
Learning log - web logging system for tracking information you received on a particular topic. Project on Python with Django framework.

# Specification
I will write a web application called Learning Log that will allow the user to keep a log of topics of interest to them and create log entries as they learn each topic.
The Learning Log home page contains a description of the site and prompts the user to register or enter their credentials.
After a successful login, the user is able to create new topics, add new posts, read and edit existing posts.
